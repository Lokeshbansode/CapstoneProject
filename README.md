# Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics

This is my Capstone project for Boston Institue of Analytics. I will be analyzing the fictional dataset, SUPERMART GROCERY SALES - RETAIL ANALYTICS. The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends and pattern of sales by Supermart Grocery. This analysis will be done using numPy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries in python programming language.
Create a Dashboard in Power BI for visualization.
